Using a forest motif, it metaphorically represents Incomplex guiding clients out of the confusion and complexity of their current workflows and into clarity and actionable solutions. The visual style is rich in detail and texture, creating an emotional connection with the audience, while the high-contrast colour palette of saturated oranges, cooler blues, and dark teals establishes energy and trust. Hero mockups for both mobile and desktop explore varied compositions and perspectives to reinforce approachability, warmth, and the idea of personal guidance, emphasizing that Incomplex bridges gaps in capability while remaining empathetic and relatable.",

The design is modern and structured, leveraging grid-based layouts, clean lines, and a high-contrast palette of saturated oranges and cooler blues to reinforce technical competence and forward-thinking ideals. Hero mockups for desktop and mobile explore spatial hierarchy and visual clarity, ensuring the narrative communicates precision, professionalism, and strategic impact.

In an era of AI and rapid change in the industry, being seen as forward thinking and adaptable is particularly important. This direction is far more in alignment with that messaging",

Designing it fully in Figma, then using AI to enhance with complex scroll animations and practical code to be used as reference for incomplex's development team. I also developed a logo suite, typography system and personally hand drew all of the icons and illustrations throughout the site using photoshop and adobe Illustrator.",
